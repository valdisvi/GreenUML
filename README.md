====================================================================================================================

Green is a LIVE round-tripping editor, meaning that it supports both software engineering and reverse engineering. 
You can use green to create a UML class diagram from code, or to generate code by drawing a class diagram.

The editor features a simple point-and-click interface. Right-clicking in the editor brings up a 
context-sensitive menu that includes features such as the refactoring and quick-fix functionality.
Green supports exporting files to JPG, PNG and GIF formats, as well as saving them as Green UML projects, so that you can share you diagrams without any issues.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute to this project, please create a fork of this and commit all of your changes there.

Please note that Green UML is effectively a collection of plug-ins (see [the structure overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanisPelss/GreenUML/master/GreenHelp/green-structure.png)). Development of each  plug-in is performed in a separate Eclipse project. There are also additional projects: an _update site_ project `GreenUpdateSite` (used to create an Eclipse plug-in installation web site), and _feature_ projects: `GreenFeature`, `GreenRelationshipsFeature` and `GreenSVGSaveFeature` (used to package groups of plug-ins together into installable and updatable units which are then uploaded to the update site).

### Requirements to develop Green UML:
- [Eclipse Modelling Tools (package Neon R)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Neon/R)
- [GMF Tooling](http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/gmf-tooling/updates/releases/)

### What can be improved:
- Green UML is working only on Eclipse 4.6 Neon now, further development could target other Eclipse versions
- Additional functionality

## Bugs
